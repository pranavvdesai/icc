## Problem Statement
There is a need for a better mechanism aimed towards keeping fan experience at the center and thereby encouraging more active participation from fans during cricket matches.

Despite the presence of contests and other activities during matches, only a small percentage of fans actually participate in them due to a lack of incentives.

Fans are still required to bring physical copies of tickets to enter the stadium for live matches, which is an outdated system.

This outdated ticketing system leads to corruption and inflated prices for tickets.

The current ticketing system only serves the purpose of allowing entry into the stadium to watch the live match and does not offer any additional benefits or functionality to enhance the fan experience.

## Idea Description
Implementing NFTs as tickets for cricket matches can provide more value to the fans and enhance the overall fan experience.

The NFT ticket would hold value in the form of tokens, which can be spent on food, merchandise, or other offerings.

This can also serve as an entry point to participate in further contests during the game, providing an incentive for fans to engage actively and potentially earn more tokens.

Fans would have a unique avatar, created at the time of profile creation and as the user engages with ICC and its products, participate in contests using tokens, the avatar level increases along with potential to earn more tokens. Once a certain level has been reached, the fans get access to VIP areas, meet players, get signed match ball,etc.

# Ticket as a wallet
- The user buys the ticket which gets minted as an NFT. This Ticket NFT is associated with tokens. The user mints token on a 1:1 ratio of what he pays for the ticket.
- Tokens can be used to buy
food, goodies, and
redeemable for merchandise,
entry to contests
- Tickets as tokens provide
hassle-free entry to stadiums,
cricket matches, and other
ICC contests.
- This eliminates the problem
of resale, where tickets are
sold at rates higher than their
original price.
- QR associated with each ticket, so that the user doesnt have to wait in the long queues for buying food or entry into stadiums.
- The tokens get deducted frfom the user and gets transferred to the seller upon scanning.
- These tickets can be transferred during a match and after a match can be traded.

# Personalised Avatars
- A personalised Avatar is given to each user upon signing in.
- These avatars act as a entry point to exclusive ICC events like meet and greet with cricketers, signed ball, chat with commentator, accces to ground and VIP boxes.
- The more the user interacts with icc products, the more contests he wins, the more his avatar levels up
- As you progress through levels with your avatar, you will
                      receive a distinctive accessory that becomes increasingly
                      rare as you advance. The more rare your avatar's
                      attributes are, the more rare your avatar becomes,
                      increasing the value of its associated NFT.
- Fans can compete for a rare attribute for their avatar for eg, dhoni's digital bat as a accessory. This will gamify the user experience.
- This could also be integrated with crictos, where the avatar can be the users own player and could inherit traits from a real world cricketer.

## Future Work
- Custom AR/VR filters based on avatar level  (can be used for social media contests) 
- Developing our own private blockchain and ledger
- Personalized notifications and feed based on user's interaction with ICC products (Machine Learning and Artificial intelligence)
- Market research with stadium vendors and store owners to implement the functionality for stadium stall owners and food vendors in stadium
